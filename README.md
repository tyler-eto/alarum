# alarum (latin alarm)
a text-based game written for OSU course CS162


## Description
a lovecraftian, sci-fi game set on the recently destroyed ship, SONUM. A black hole has appeared seemingly out of nowhere and blown your ship to pieces. luckily, life support systems kicked in and every piece of the ship is still air-locked, drifting in space. you have access to an airsuit that allows you to drift through space to distant ship pieces. as a survivor, you must make your way through the destroyed ship and find the captainâ€™s keycard to access the escape pods. there is an additional win scenario (true ending) that involves collecting mysterious runes scattered across the ship that might have had something to do with the disaster. can you escape the dangers and horrors of the ship before they destroy you?

alarum features both a tailor-made and rogue-like version of the game.
